                  I’m overwhelmed thinking of how life is going to be for us soon,
                  when you come into this world. I’m overwhelmed thinking of
                  everything we still need to do before your arrival And so, sweet
                  Baby, thank you. Thank you for already filling us with so much
                  love. Thank you for already being our missing puzzle piece. I
                  can’t wait to meet you.

                I want you to know how precious you are and always will be to me.
                You are my first child. My first son. My first everything, really.
                In the years to come, I will teach you so much, but you have
                already taught me infinite amounts. You have taught me what it is
                to be a mother. You have taught me pure love. You have taught me
                that it is possible to have a piece of my heart outside of my
                body. And it’s such a scary thing, but more than that, it’s
                beautiful.

                I pray that you grow up strong and sweet and that you have a heart
                for others. I pray that you never let this world dull your bright
                and lovely personality. I pray that the world is less cruel to you
                than it can be. Because it will be cruel. But I’ll do my best to
                soften it, if even just a little. I pray that you are courageous
                and kind and generous and patient. I already see so much of this
                in you, and it makes me so proud to call you mine.

                Oh my dear baby, He just turned 3 months on 8th of july. So, a
                little bit about Michael at 3 months. He is smiling all the time
                now, and has started to giggle for real too, which is the best!!

                Michael just turned 6 months, He has 2 teeth now which are so
                tiny. He smiles at everyone- the biggest cheeks you’ve ever seen.
                He loves tummy time and will instantly roll right over to his
                tummy when put down, happily as can be.
